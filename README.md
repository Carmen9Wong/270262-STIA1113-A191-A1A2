## Introduction

In this assignment, I have to write a java program to calculate a monthly payment. First, I do a pseudocode and flow chart before write a java program. I have used do…while loop in programming. The do/while loop is a variant of the while loop. This loop will execute the code block once, before checking if the condition is true, then it will repeat the loop as long as the condition is true. So, by using do…while loop, I can limit the input by keeping looping until the amount entered to calculate the monthly payment.

## Pseudocode to calculate the perimeter of a rectangle

```
Start
Output “Key in car price (RM):”
Input car price
Loop the input of car price if car price is less than RM30000
Output “Key in down payment (RM):”
Input down payment
Loop the input of down payment if the car payment is less than 1
Output “Key in loan period (Years):”
Input loan payment
Loop the input of loan payment if loan payment is less than 5 years or more than 9 years
Output “Key in interest rate (%):”
Input interest rate 
Loop the interest rate if interest rate is less than 3% or more than 7%
Calculate total interest = (car price – down payment) / 100 * interest rate
Calculate monthly payment = (total payment amount / loan period / 12)


```
